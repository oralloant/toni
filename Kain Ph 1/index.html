<h1 style="font: size 40px;"> Filipino Street Food </h1>
<br>
<br>
<p>Like most Asians, a Filipino meal would consist of three large meal a day.
    Aside from that, Filipinos love having
    several snacks in between their day. 
    What better way to have a Filipino snack than munching on STREETFOODS. <br></p>  
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>
Southeast Asia can offer a wide array of street food. The Philippines being one of them. 
Trying one would be quite an experience. If you think you've got an iron stomach, 
enough bioflora in your gut and a lot of antibody to your system, 
dare to enter the gastronomical world of streetfood the Philippines has to offer.  </p>

<br>
<p>This mobile stand usually roaming around the vicinity of the town's streets. 
As shown in the picture, the vendor which is typically called "manong" or "manang" is selling an array of fried snacks.
From kikiam, squidballs, one-day old chick, kwek kwek, hotdog to siomai.</p>  
<br>
<p>It is self service. You get your bamboo stick and your plastic cup or paper plate which is located on the side of the stand 
    then you start picking with your stick. It is also served with a variety of savory dips from sweet to sour to spicy. </p>

<br>
<p>Another mobile stand, But unlike the "tusok-tusok" stand they usually only serve early in the morning or late in the afternoon until evening.
Those gigantic pots were: noodles which are the beef mami; congee which Filipinos call goto/lugaw serve with pig insides/chicken eggs/ chicken tenders, 
and; pares which is a sweet, umami beef soup. All of which are serve in a bowl. </p>
